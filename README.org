* A little about my system

I have a lot of Emacs :smile:

| Package Manager/Distribution | Guix/GuixSD             |
| Window Manager               | Emacs (EXWM)            |
| Application launcher         | Emacs (kd/app-launcher) |
| Code editor                  | Emacs                   |
| Terminal Emulator            | Emacs (vterm or eshell) |

** My Emacs

It is a little slow configuration. I trying to optimize this config.

I have a little features in my Emacs:
- Torrent client
- Application launcher
- Window Manager
- LSP
  - =lsp-mode=
  - =lsp-ui=
  - =lsp-treemacs=
- Completion (company/vertico/consult)
- Doom Modeline
- A lot of languages
  - Rust
  - C/C++
  - CMake
  - Toml
  - Python
  - Zig
    
*** Keybindings

| =eval-buffer (user-init-directory)= | =C-c r=            | Reload Emacs             |
| =kd/app-launcher=                   | =C-c SPC=          | Run application launcher |
| =consult-grep= or =consult-rigrep=  | =SPC g=            | Finding a buffer         |
| =consult-buffer=                    | =SPC b= or =C-M-j= | Switch to buffer         |
| =consult-imenu=                     | =SPC i=            | Go to item               |

| =hydra-text-scale/body=             | =SPC t s=          | Scale text               |

*** TODO I will do it in future

- [ ] A lot of keybindings for =evil-mode= with =general=, =hydra= and =which-key=
  - [ ] LSP actions in =SPC l=
  - [ ] =consult-grep= or =consult-ripgrep= in =SPC g=
  - [ ] =consult-buffer= in =SPC b=
  - [ ] =consult-imenu= in =SPC i=
  - [ ] =consult-flymake= in =SPC f m=
- [ ] Debugging with =dap-mode=

* Scheme code

Main Scheme source files:
- qemu-image.scm - VM image for qemu
