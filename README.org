* A little about my system

I have a lot of Emacs :smile:

| *Package Manager/Distribution* | Guix/GuixSD             |
| *Window Manager*               | Emacs (EXWM)            |
| *Application launcher*         | Emacs (kd/app-launcher) |
| *Code editor*                  | Emacs                   |
| *Terminal Emulator*            | Emacs (vterm or eshell) |
| *Telegram Client*              | Emacs (telega.el)       |

** My Emacs

It is a little slow configuration. I trying to optimize this config.

I have a little features in my Emacs:
- Telegram client
- Torrent client
- Application launcher
- Window Manager
- LSP
  - =lsp-mode=
  - =lsp-ui=
  - =lsp-treemacs=
- Completion (company/vertico/consult)
- Doom Modeline
- A lot of languages
  - Rust
  - C/C++
  - CMake
  - Toml
  - Yaml
  - Python
  - Zig
    
*** Keybindings

These are keybindings created only by me manually.

| =eval-buffer (user-init-directory)= | =C-c r=            | Reload Emacs             |
| =kd/app-launcher=                   | =C-c SPC=          | Run application launcher |
| =consult-grep= or =consult-rigrep=  | =SPC g=            | Finding a buffer         |
| =consult-buffer=                    | =SPC b= or =C-M-j= | Switch to buffer         |
| =consult-imenu=                     | =SPC i=            | Go to item               |
| =consult-line=                      | =SPC s= or =C-s=   | Go to line               |
| =consult-theme=                     | =SPC t t=          | Choose theme             |
| =hydra-text-scale/body=             | =SPC t s=          | Scale text               |

*** TODO I will do it in future

- [-] A lot of keybindings for =evil-mode= with =general=, =hydra= and =which-key=
  - [ ] LSP actions in =SPC l=
  - [X] =consult-grep= or =consult-ripgrep= in =SPC g=
  - [X] =consult-buffer= in =SPC b=
  - [X] =consult-imenu= in =SPC i=
  - [X] =consult-line= in =SPC s=
  - [X] =consult-theme= in =SPC t t=
  - [X] =hydra-text-scale/body= in =SPC t s=
- [ ] Debugging with =dap-mode=
- [ ] Telegram client (telega.el) configuration
  - [ ] Vertico completion with =telega-*= commands
  - [ ] Use =SPC m t= as =telega.el= prefix

* Scheme code

Main Scheme source files:
- =disk-image.scm= - Disk image
- =home.scm= - Home environment

Other code files in =scheme/=. Load path is appended
in =GNUmakefile= as =guix= options in =${OPTIONS}= variable
